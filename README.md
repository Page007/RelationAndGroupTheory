# RelationAndGroupTheory
Programs that take input as relation matrix and tell you what kind of matrix it is. Also it determines whether a set and a defined operator
on the set forms an algebraic system, semi-group, monoid, groups or Abelian group.
It is a loop intensive code, but I would appreciate it if anyone would help me out with some other approach.
The code has been written in Visual Studio 2017 and if you want to open it in Linux based systems, you can do so by cloning the file and opening the .cpp file in the Q1 folder.
